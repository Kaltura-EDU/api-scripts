## [v1.1] - 2025-05-07
### Changed
- Replaced hardcoded Kaltura category property assignments with global variables
  (e.g., USER_JOIN_POLICY, MODERATION, etc.) to allow full configuration from the top of the script.
- Integrated flake8-friendly formatting: wrapped long lines, formatted list comprehensions, and cleaned print statements.
- Ensured `member_list` is always defined, even if `MEMBERS` is left blank (prevents NameError).
- Improved script output formatting: aligned key labels and added generated channel URL.
- Added a module-level docstring to describe the scriptâ€™s purpose.
