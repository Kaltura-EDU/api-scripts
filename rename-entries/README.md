# Description
This script allows you to rename Kaltura media entries in batches. You can add something to the entries' titles at the beginning or at the end (a prefix or a suffix). You can select what entries you'd like to rename by using one of the following:

- a tag
- a category
- a comma-delimited list of entry IDs
