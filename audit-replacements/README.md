# Check Kaltura Entry Replacements

This Python script identifies Kaltura media entries that have been replaced by looking for `media::updatecontent` actions in the audit trail. It compares each replacement timestamp against the original entry's creation time and only includes entries with confirmed replacements in the output file.

## 🔍 Use Case

Designed primarily for instructional media admins or instructional designers who need to **verify whether media entries were replaced**—e.g., after course revisions or content corrections. Useful for reporting or auditing when changes occurred and who made them.

## ✅ What It Does

- Prompts the user to search by:
  - Tag
  - Category ID
  - Comma-delimited list of Entry IDs
- Retrieves entries based on the selected method.
- Fetches audit trail data for each entry.
- Compares `media::updatecontent` timestamps to each entry's creation date.
- Outputs only entries that have been replaced (i.e., where an update occurred after creation).
- Lists **both creation and replacement events** per entry.
- Formats timestamps in **Pacific Time (PT)**.

Note: Only entries that have been replaced — meaning they have one or more `media::updatecontent` actions recorded after their creation date — will be included in the resulting Excel file. Entries with no replacement history will be skipped entirely.

## 📦 Output

An Excel file named like `2025-06-11-1453_ReplacementsAudit.xlsx`, with the following columns:

- `entry_id`
- `title`
- `action` (either `creation` or `replacement`)
- `user_id`
- `timestamp` (Pacific Time, suffixed with "PT")

## 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:

```
pytz
pandas
KalturaApiClient
lxml
openpyxl
```

## 🔐 Configuration

At the top of the script, you must provide:

```python
PARTNER_ID = ""        # Your Kaltura partner ID
ADMIN_SECRET = ""      # Your Kaltura admin secret
```

The script creates an admin session using:
```python
privileges="all:*,disableentitlement"
```

## 🏁 Running the Script

From the command line:
```bash
python3 check-replacements.py
```

Then follow the prompt to enter your preferred search method.

## Notes

- Some older entries may not have creation events logged, and thus will not appear unless they’ve been replaced since the Audit Trail was enabled.
- Playlists and non-media entries are automatically excluded.

## Important Notes

This script depends on the Kaltura **Audit Trail** module, which must be enabled in your Kaltura environment. If your Kaltura account does not have Audit Trail enabled, calls to `auditTrail.list` may fail, and the script will not return any replacement data. Also note that even once Audit Trail is enabled, entries are only tracked *from that point forward* — actions on entries that occurred before Audit Trail was activated will not appear in the logs.
