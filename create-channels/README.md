# Bulk Kaltura Channel Creation

This script allows you to create multiple Kaltura MediaSpace channels in bulk by reading from a CSV input file. Each channel will be created under a specified parent category with designated owners and members.

## What It Does
- Creates Kaltura channels using the Kaltura API
- Assigns owners and adds members to each channel
- Outputs a CSV summary of all created channels, including direct MediaSpace links (leveraging the MEDIA_SPACE_BASE_URL variable

## üìÇ CSV Input File
Your input file should be named `channelDetails.csv` and placed in the same
directory as the script.

### Required Columns
| Column       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channelName` | The name of the channel to be created                                        |
| `owner`       | The Kaltura user ID of the channel owner                                     |
